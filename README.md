# Syndrome2Vec


Syndrome2Vec is a lightweight analysis toolkit for exploring the **geometric structure of quantum error-correction syndromes**.  
It is **not a decoder** and does **not modify hardware or stabilizers**. Instead, it provides a way to **diagnose when and why existing decoders succeed or fail** by studying the geometry of multi-round syndrome data.

The core idea is simple but powerful:

> Repeated stabilizer measurements are not independent bits — they are **trajectories generated by an underlying physical noise process**.  
> When embedded into a compact latent space, these trajectories organize into a **low-dimensional manifold** whose geometry reflects fault structure, correlations, and decoder reliability.

This repository provides tools to **visualize, quantify, and interpret that geometry**.

## Conceptual Background

In stabilizer-based quantum error correction (e.g. the surface code), each circuit execution produces:

- a **syndrome history**: binary detection events across space and time  
- a **decoder output**: e.g. MWPM’s predicted logical correction  
- a **ground-truth logical outcome**

Traditional decoding treats each shot as a flat bitstring. Syndrome2Vec instead treats each shot as a **point in a geometric space**.

Empirically, we observe:

- Typical low-weight Pauli-like faults cluster in a **dense interior region**
- Correlated, high-weight, or atypical faults lie on a **sparse boundary**
- **MWPM failures localize almost entirely to this low-density boundary**

This suggests that **latent geometry is an intrinsic, decoder-agnostic indicator of when matching assumptions break down**.

## What This Repository Does

This repo provides **analysis-only tooling** to help researchers:

- Embed multi-round syndrome data into a latent space
- Visualize the resulting geometry (UMAP / 2D projections)
- Estimate local density in latent space
- Quantify decoder error rate as a function of latent density
- Localize decoder failures geometrically

It is designed to work with **any decoder** and **any code**, as long as you can export arrays.

## Inputs

The analysis expects three NumPy arrays:

```
syndromes.npy # shape: [N, T, D] or [N, TD]
decoder_outputs.npy # shape: [N] (e.g. MWPM predictions)
logical_labels.npy # shape: [N] (ground-truth logical outcomes)
```


No assumptions are made about:
- the code family
- the decoder
- the noise model

---

## Outputs

Running the analysis produces:

- **Latent embedding plots** (UMAP / PCA)
- **Density maps** of syndrome space
- **Logical error probability vs latent density curves**
- **Geometric localization of decoder failures**

These plots provide a **quantitative bridge** between:
- syndrome structure
- physical noise processes
- decoder performance

---

The repo is intentionally modular so labs can plug in:
- their own embeddings
- their own decoders
- their own codes

---

## What This Is *Not*

- Not a replacement decoder  
- Not a hardware proposal  
- Not a stabilizer design  
- Not a benchmarking leaderboard  

It is a **diagnostic lens** — a way to *see* where fault-tolerant assumptions hold and where they break.

---

## Intended Use

This toolkit is useful for:

- Analyzing why MWPM fails under correlated noise
- Studying noise drift geometrically
- Comparing decoder behavior across regimes
- Identifying “hard” fault populations
- Informing adaptive or hybrid decoding strategies

Even if the embeddings are never reused, the **geometry itself is informative**.

---

## Reproducibility & Philosophy

This repository intentionally contains **analysis code only**.

Trained model weights (if used) may be:
- provided privately
- retrained by users
- replaced by alternative embeddings

The scientific claim does **not** depend on a specific neural architecture — it depends on the **existence and structure of the manifold**.
